# Nullvoid_Subscription-Manager
This is a subscription manager project.
Everything nowadays is based on subscriptions. Amazon Prime Subscription, Netflix Subscription, Disney+Hotstar, Office 365, Youtube Premium, Spotify Premium etc. With all these subscriptions comes the tedious task of remembering the dates of renewals and auto-renewals. The Subscription Manager takes away all of your worries about these messy details. Just add the Subscription data and leave the rest on to the app. When you add a new subscription of a service to the app, it automatically creates a calendar event for you to remind to cancel the subscription on the last day of your subscription period.
